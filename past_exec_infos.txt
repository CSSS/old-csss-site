James Hannah

Favourite Courses - CMPT 300 | CMPT 307

Languages of Choice - Rust

Bio - James lived in Halifax until he was 18, when he had to leave because his dad required him to go away for university. Not being one to do something half way, he decided Vancouver was a good place to go. Despite having no real experience with programming, he started studying Computing Science at SFU. It’s worked out so far. He enjoys strategy games, running in the woods, and learning programming languages.

or leave a note encrypted in ROT13 in the common room, and David will leave another note encrypted in ROT26 for you to pick up within the week.

Bio - Born and raised in North Vancouver, David came to SFU for various reasons, one of which was because some random guy in a TF2 server said something about SFU being good for Computing, and he decided that was good evidence. It ended up being pretty true. David can now be found sitting in the common room too much, generally being loud and occasionally running down the halls.

David likes to think he's decently friendly, so feel free to bug him about pretty much anything.

Contact - pwallan@sfu.ca | Carrier Pigeon

Bio - Paul is a second year Computing Science student. Paul went to a small high-school in Port Coquitlam and chose SFU because of how close it was to his house compared to UBC.

Jeffrey Leung
Favourite Courses - CMPT 276 | CMPT 127
Languages of Choice - C++ | anything that is not JavaScript
Responsibilities - Jeffrey occupies one of the 16 seats at the Board of Directors, the highest governing executive body of the SFSS whose task is to "determine what the members want and need, prioritize amongst those needs, and ensure that the organization actually provides for those needs". Jeffrey works closely with the student unions and students of FAS to ensure that their views and needs are represented. He also works on various SFSS committees for projects such as governance reform and Surrey Campus advocacy/events.
Bio - A 4th year student and loyal convert from Computing Science to Software Systems, Jeffrey spends a lot of his time in the CSSS common room as a traitor and spy. Though some people believe he enjoys the work he does for the student societies, he's actually just here for the free pizza. Just like Corbett Gildersleve, one of his predecessors, Jeffrey has no plans whatsoever for graduation.
