James Hannah

Favourite Courses - CMPT 300 | CMPT 307

Languages of Choice - Rust

Bio - James lived in Halifax until he was 18, when he had to leave because his dad required him to go away for university. Not being one to do something half way, he decided Vancouver was a good place to go. Despite having no real experience with programming, he started studying Computing Science at SFU. It’s worked out so far. He enjoys strategy games, running in the woods, and learning programming languages.

or leave a note encrypted in ROT13 in the common room, and David will leave another note encrypted in ROT26 for you to pick up within the week.

Bio - Born and raised in North Vancouver, David came to SFU for various reasons, one of which was because some random guy in a TF2 server said something about SFU being good for Computing, and he decided that was good evidence. It ended up being pretty true. David can now be found sitting in the common room too much, generally being loud and occasionally running down the halls.

David likes to think he's decently friendly, so feel free to bug him about pretty much anything.

Paul Allan

Favourite Courses - CMPT 127 | CMPT 165

Languages of Choice - C | Python | JavaScript

Contact - pwallan@sfu.ca | Carrier Pigeon

Bio - Paul is a second year Computing Science student. Paul went to a small high-school in Port Coquitlam and chose SFU because of how close it was to his house compared to UBC. Initially a 2012 froshee, Paul took 2 1/2 years off school to work after the Fall 2013 term, returning to find things somewhat similar to how he left them, except with the CSSS having a new vending machine and the froshees looking different than how he remembered them. In the past, he has been the Secretary (now know as the Director of Archives and Director of Communications) and the Executive at Large twice.
